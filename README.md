# Goroutines Demo
This is a quick demo of goroutines.

## Building
1. Install go (golang)
1. In the project dir, run:
```
go build
```

## Running
The program accepts 1 arg, a groutine count
```
./goroutine-demo 1000
```

You can also use `run.sh`. This will log the number of threads the program creates.
```
./run.sh 1000
```
